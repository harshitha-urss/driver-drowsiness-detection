    <!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
    <section>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            In real emergencies, delayed reporting and false alerts often cost lives.

    <!-- INSPIRATION -->
    <section>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            This idea was inspired by a real-life medical emergency involving my grandfather.
            That moment revealed how crucial fast emergency reporting and accurate verification are.
            SafeAlert is designed to minimize false alerts and speed up real emergency responses.
